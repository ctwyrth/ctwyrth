- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas!

- 👀 I’m interested in Marvel Comics and the Cinematic Universe, Star Wars in all its iterations, Legos, WoW, gaming, cooking, eating, happy music, and singing out loud badly!

- 🌱 I’m currently a freelance coder.... software developer... web developer, it's all a little muddled at this point, isn't it?

- 💞️ I’m looking for work/projects to reinforce my coding aptitudes and gain new proficiencies.
