- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas!
- 👀 I’m interested in Marvel Comics and the Cinematic Universe, Star Wars in all its iterations, Legos, WoW, gaming, cooking, eating, happy music, and singing out loud badly!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code.... software develop... web develop, it's all a little muddled at this point, isn't it?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help reinforce the skills I'm learning and that will hopefully make me more appealing to an employer.
- 📫 How to reach me...
